# Intro
This page is highly inspired by [NUS's seniors advice to their juniors](https://github.com/nushackers/notes-to-cs-freshmen-from-the-future)  
Head to that page too and just ignore the NUS specific advice on modules  
I'll be giving my thoughts based on my experience in UOW-SIM's Computer Science, Digital Systems Security degree.  

# Focus on the basics 
If you're new to computer science and programming like I was, stick to the basics and make sure they are rock solid  
In UOW-SIM, the modules 111 (Intro to Programming) and 121 (Object Oriented Programming) are the modules that gave me and will give you the programming fundamentals to build upon for the rest of your degree.  
The level 100 modules form the basis of what you need to know for the future modules. Make sure you understand what is being taught. 

## What does understand what is being taught mean?
For me, this meant that as new concepts are being taught in the lectures, I could understand how the concepts are pieced together, or at least that it made sense.  
At the level 200 or 300 modules, some topics are built upon the fundamentals taught in earlier modules and is more of an extension rather than new concept.  
The lectures are paced so that you can understand them, make sure you can at least give a different example of the same concept while looking at the lecture notes after the lecture. 

## Pay attention to the lectures
Thought I'd add this in, lectures are 3 hours each, with a break in between. Get used to it and pay attention during the lectures.  
There might be recordings but they are meant to supplement the lectures, not replace them.  

# Learn how to learn
Modules in UOW are taught in 7 to 8 weeks, and you'll be taking 2 modules per semester.  
This means that in 2 months you have:
- 20 Lectures or so (10 lectures x 2 modules)
- 20 Labs/Tutorial or so (10 tutorial x 2 modules)
- 4-6 assignments or so (2-3 asn x 2 modules)
- 2 finals to revise (finals are usually 1st week of the 3rd month)  
It may sound daunting but it is definitely more than manageable. However, it isn't a trivial amount too.  
So, find out how you learn best, for some it may be videos, for others it may be hands-on or reading about it.  
Invest the time to find out and learn what works best for you as you'll still be learning while at work after you graduate.

# Learn how to focus
Most of your work will likely come from uninterrupted blocks of focused work. Learn how to create an environment where you can focus, and get used to sitting and focusing on work.  
Google "Pomodoro technique" for starters, and trial and error what works for you. For reference, I did 50 minutes of work and 10 minutes of rest at the start.  

# Approach school with an open mindset
Treat school as the practice ground for various things. Figure out how you work best in terms of learning and personal life, which field of computer science you like, and what you don't like.  
Don't try to min-max past the degree and go into the working world.  
When you start working, you'll be required to learn things on your own and on the fly rather than being given 60 hours of lessons.  
School is the prep, make good use of it. Grades are not everything but they are an important indicator of how well you're coping, assuming you've been doing everything on your own. Use your grades to adjust and improve your processes.  

# Do the assignments yourself, don't ChatGPT
On the same note as the few points above, don't ask your friends for help on the assignments and don't chatgpt them for the level 100 or 200 modules.  
If you require help, ask your tutorial teacher but only when you've tried all you can without chatgpt or asking your friends. Learning how to debug your issues is a skill in itself.  
If anything, be the one teaching your friends.
Most of the information required for the assignments are in the lecture notes and tutorial resources. Even googling the topic might be slower than just going straight to the lecture notes.  
Assignments are meant for you to practice the concepts, even though they are part of your grade. The more you rely on external help, the more you'll struggle for the finals, which are basically just assignments in an exam settings.  
You're also given ample time, from 1 week to 2/3 weeks to complete them. People learn at different rates, but you can complete most assignments within 4 full days where you focus.  
And of course, don't wait till the last minute to start doing them.  

## When to ChatGPT?
I don't recommend chatgpt for the level 100 and 200 modules, they teach the fundamentals and you should be able to do them without chatgpt. Chatgpt-ing for these modules assignments usually means getting the answer straight.  
Once you're in your final year, chatgpt for the simple things that you might have forgot such as programming syntax that you already know but forgot the exact format, to save you time from googling them.  
Also, chatgpt can be wrong and you wouldn't know it if you're learning from chatgpt.  

# Use the free time to learn new things
The biggest benefit of UOW for me was the extra time I got to learn things that interested me by being efficient with school related tasks.  
By pre-reading and paying attention in the lectures and tutorials, it helps in completing the assignments quickly.  
Revision for the finals aren't as daunting as well, as it becomes more of memorizing specific parts over understanding the concepts.  
It's your own freedom on how you spend your free time after school, but this field is only going to get more competitive. Learn or do self-initiated projects to help yourself stand out.  
I'll be including a list of things to start with in the "Things I wished I knew" section.

# Tips for learning 
Here are some tips that I found useful in no particular order.
## Pre-read the lecture notes
The lecture notes are usually released in advanced. Run through them to know what to expect.  
You don't have to understand them 100% before the lesson and some slides won't make sense until the lectures.  
Pre-reading will prepare you to learn the parts you didn't understand rather than just attending the lecture blindly.

## Youtube / Read from other sources
School lectures are not the only resources where you can learn from. Don't rely on them solely.  
The topics taught in school are not special, you can youtube or google them to learn them better.  
I will include a few youtube resources for the modules where I've used them in the sub-folders of this repository. I learn better through videos, if your learning style leans to reading, explore and find what works for you.  

## Attend and pay attention during tutorials
Tutorials are where you solidify your understanding. Make sure you follow along and clear up your doubts. They are also the time where you ask questions regarding your assignments.

## Handwriting code before finals
Exams are pen and paper, even for the programming modules.  
It then makes sense to write in pen and paper for your finals revision to memorize the syntax.  

## You don't need the textbooks
I made it through my degree from 2021-2023 without buying the textbooks, in case you're wondering if you need to spend the money to.  

# Things I wish I knew when I started / Things you can look up 
I'd recommend visiting this section after your first two semesters.  
Focus on school for the first two semesters first before branching out.  
## Git
Git is something you'll use to collaborate with your teammates in the future, as long as at work.  
Get used to using it.  
Just make sure you're comfortable with these concepts:
- git add
- git commit 
- git pull
- git push
- how to undo commit
- create new branch
- check out to new branch
- git rebase 
- git merge
- how to solve merge conflicts

## Books to read
[List](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/12-most-infuential-books-every-software-engineer-needs-jason-roell/)
Knowing the existence of Clean Code, tesing, test driven development etc. has had a great impact on me. This is the list of books I'm currently referring to.  

## YouTubers 
Here are some videos and Youtubers to start with.  
- [bigboxSWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nogh434ykF0)
- [Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JokSCmRp_s&t=514s)
- [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtfbWkxJTHw)

## Command Line / Terminal
You'll be required to use the terminal a few times over the course of your degree.  
Take a couple of hours to familiarize yourself with the most used commands in [Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag).  

## Learn the bare basics of VIM
You may encounter a situation where you're using a text editor like [VIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggSyF1SVFr4). Know the bare basics to navigate your way around.  

## Technical Interviews
When looking for jobs, you'll be given technical interviews on top of behavorial interview which are meant to assess your technical abilities.  
The most famous practice resource would be Leetcode, in which questions are divided into Easy, Medium and Hard.  
The questions are called Data Structures and Algorithm(DSA) questions. 
There are also take-home assesments instead of the DSA questions where you'll be asked to build an app or something similar within a certain time frame.  

### Start with Codewars first
However, I recommend easing into these questions by using another practice resource called "Codewars".  
You start off at 8-kyu and you can go all the way up to 1-kyu etc.  
After completing 111 and 121, you should be able to solve 6-kyu problems.  
After 203, you can start to look into Leetcode Easy.

### Leetcode, NeetCode
For leetcode, you might not be able to solve the Easy questions at the start and that's okay.  
There's a youtuber called [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgQjes7MgTM), his explanations are great.  
203 teaches the knowledge required for this, Data Structures and Algorithms, make sure to understand the materials.  
But I'd recommend not researching into this until you've completed 111 at least, or even 121.   

## Don't stress over what to learn
Learn what you're interested in.  
As a fresh graduate, it's expected that you won't be experienced in the technology the company is using.  
That's why I stress the importance of fundamentals as the concepts are transferable between programming languages.  
Anything is better than nothing.  

## FreeCodeCamp and Odin Project
If you're interested in building websites, here are some resources to get you started:
- (FreeCodeCamp)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/]
- (The Odin Project)[https://www.theodinproject.com/paths]

## Docker
Docker is something you should know of after completing 121.  
Here's a [resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg19Z8LL06w) to get you started.  
Feel free to explore for your own resources.  

## Amazon Web Services
AWS is the leading cloud service provider and you may even be using it for your FYP.  
Know of it's existence, look it up on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFtXnCmYx3s) or Udemy to see if you're interested. 

## The different types of specializations
Computer Science is very broad and the amount of things to learn can be quite daunting.  
If you know what you're interested in, you can then tailor your skillset to be more appealing when you look for a job.  
Here are some broad categories you can look into:
### Software Engineer / Frontend Developer
In this field, solid basics in HTML, CSS and Javascript, followed by knowing some sort of framework like React, Ruby on Rails, Angular, Django. Having a portfolio of sites you've created would help.  

### Software Engineer/ Backend Developer
It's a bit broad in this category. Know a programming language beyond what school teaches you, have good understanding of programming concepts.  
School starts you off with Java, Python is an elective and there's C++ in advanced programming.  
It's also good to know about testing, containerization, CI/CD. School teaches these in 314 but it can be introduced quite late.  

### DevOps Engineer
Knowing a major cloud provider (Amazon Web Services/Microsoft Azure/Google Cloud), CI/CD (GitLab CI/CD/GitHub Actions), Infrastrucure-as-code such as Terraform, Docker, bash scripts, Kubernetes, will be a great start to become a DevOps Engineer.  

### Quality Engineer / Test Engineer/ Software Engineer in Test
A field I'm not too familiar with, they are software engineers that specialize in testing. It's good to know about unit tests, regression tests, test driven development concepts, as well as Selenium and Playwright for a start.  

### Mobile Application Engineer
A field I'm not too familiar with, major technologies used that come to mind are Kotlin (Android), Swift (IOS), Flutter (Cross platform). Just get started build your apps no matter how simple they are.  

### Data Engineer / ML 
A field I'm not too familiar with, make sure you're in the Big Data Major for a start.  
Be comfortable with Python, Databases, [R](https://www.w3schools.com/r/), machine learning model deployment and toolkits (TensorFlow/PyTorch) for a start.

### Cyber Security Engineer
Pick the Digital Systems Security major as 361 and 368 are comprehensive and give you the fundamentals for security.  
Knowledge of security concepts and strong fundamentals in C/C++ is a good start.  

## Other Fields
Other fields that I know exists but don't know enough to recommend anything are Embedded Software Engineer, Game Developer, Systems Engineer, Algorithm Engineer, Database Administrator, Analyst type jobs.  
Feel free to Google and explore them.
